# Project AP

A browser-based **multiplayer** axis/power game inspired by classics from the 90s/00s. Two players take turns firing projectiles at each other's domes over a network, adjusting power and angle to hit their opponent.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions to Render.

**Quick Deploy:**

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Render with Blueprint (`render.yaml`)
3. Set environment variables (URLs for frontend/backend)
4. Done! ðŸš€

## How to Play

### Getting Started

1. Open the game in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`)
2. **Enter your name** and **choose your color**
3. **Select number of players** (2-6) for your game
4. Click **"Find Game"**
5. Wait for other players to join (the lobby shows current count)
6. Game starts automatically when all players are ready!

**To test locally:** Open multiple browser windows/tabs and join with different names to fill up a lobby.

### Controls

**Mouse:**

- Use the **Power** slider to adjust shot power (10-100%)
- Use the **Angle** slider to adjust firing angle (0-90Â°)
- Click **Fire!** button to shoot

**Keyboard:**

- `Arrow Up/Down` - Adjust power
- `Arrow Left/Right` - Adjust angle
- `Space` or `Enter` - Fire projectile

### Gameplay

1. Players take turns firing projectiles in order (**turn indicator** shows whose turn it is)
2. Adjust power (10-100%) and angle (0-180Â°) to hit opponent domes
3. Direct hits deal damage based on proximity (watch the **health bars**)
4. Projectiles create craters that modify the terrain dynamically
5. Controls are **only active during your turn**
6. **Player cards highlight** the current player with a green glow
7. Last player standing wins! (eliminated players shown dimmed)

### Multiplayer Features

- **Variable player count** - Create 2-6 player games
- **Smart lobby system** - Players are grouped by their desired game size
- **Automatic matchmaking** - Game starts when lobby is full
- **Real-time synchronization** - Game state syncs across all clients
- **Turn-based rotation** - Turns cycle through all players in order
- **Live player tracking** - See all players, their health, and current turn status
- **Dynamic UI** - Player cards update in real-time showing health and status
- **Player customization** - Each player has their chosen name and color
- **Disconnect handling** - Game ends gracefully if any player disconnects

## Code Architecture

### Game Loop

The game uses a standard game loop with delta time for smooth animation:

- **Update**: Physics calculations and collision detection
- **Render**: Draw terrain, domes, and projectiles

### Entity System

- `Dome`: Player structures with health
- `Projectile`: Flying projectiles with physics
- `Terrain`: Procedurally generated hills with crater deformation

### Physics

Simple Newtonian physics:

- Gravity: 500 pixels/secondÂ²
- Parabolic trajectories
- Collision detection with terrain

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:

- [ ] Game lobbies with multiple rooms
- [ ] Spectator mode
- [ ] Wind effects affecting projectile trajectory
- [ ] Multiple weapon types (missiles, lasers, bombs)
- [ ] Power-ups and special abilities
- [ ] AI opponent for single-player
- [ ] Sound effects and background music
- [ ] Chat system between players
- [ ] Multiple maps/terrain types
- [ ] Ranked matchmaking and ELO system
- [ ] Score tracking and leaderboards
- [ ] Game replays and highlights
